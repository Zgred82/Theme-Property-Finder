# Theme Property Finder for Blender

**Theme Property Finder** is a productivity tool for Blender artists and theme creators. It allows you to search for specific theme properties (like colors, sizes, or boolean toggles) across all Blender editors and synchronize them with a single click.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Global Search:** Find any theme property hidden deep within Blender's API using a simple keyword search.
* **Intelligent List:** Use the "List" button to pick from a generated list of all available property names.
* **Batch Synchronization:** Update multiple editors at once. If you change a color in one editor, you can instantly sync it to the others.
* **Smart Filtering:** Results are grouped by editor type (3D View, Node Editor, etc.) for better clarity.
* **Selection Control:** Quickly select or deselect matching items to refine your batch updates.
